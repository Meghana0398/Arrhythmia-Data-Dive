The project outlines the development and evaluation of a machine learning model for ECG signal analysis using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, which contains 109,446 samples from 47 individuals. The process involves a rigorous 5-fold cross-validation strategy to ensure model resilience and generalizability. Within each fold, data is further split into an 80:20 ratio for core training and validation, preventing overfitting. An iterative optimization process refines the model based on unseen data, with classification results from the test set guiding the optimization. Evaluation metrics are crucial for assessing the model's robustness and predictive precision. Overall, this approach emphasizes cross-validation, data splitting, and iterative refinement to create an effective ECG signal analysis model.
